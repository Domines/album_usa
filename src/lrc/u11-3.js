	"00:07.64": "How do you do?",
	"00:09.15": "Hello.",
	"00:10.92": "I'm Ralph Riley.",
	"00:11.93": "I'm Richard Stewart, and this is my wife, Marilyn.",
	"00:14.58": "Pleased to meet you.",
	"00:15.23": "Likewise, Mr. Riley.",
	"00:16.50": "Please, sit down. What can I do for you?",
	"00:20.84": "We'd like to discuss a mortgage.",
	"00:23.61": "For a house.",
	"00:24.53": "Fine. Are you buying a house",
	"00:26.60": "or are you refinancing your present home?",
	"00:28.62": "We're planning to buy a house.",
	"00:30.50": "And we'd like to find out about a mortgage.",
	"00:33.04": "We are customers of the bank.",
	"00:34.80": "As a matter of fact, my whole family banks here.",
	"00:37.95": "I have some questions to ask.",
	"00:41.18": "Do you own your house or do you rent?",
	"00:43.76": "Neither.",
	"00:44.62": "We live with my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stewart.",
	"00:49.51": "And how old are you?",
	"00:51.63": "I'm twenty-nine.",
	"00:52.32": "I'm thirty.",
	"00:55.20": "And, Mr. Stewart, what is your occupation?",
	"00:58.08": "I'm a freelance photographer.",
	"00:59.93": "And, Mrs. Stewart, are you working?",
	"01:01.46": "Yes. I'm a designer, and I work in a boutique.",
	"01:04.81": "Did you bring any savings or salary information?",
	"01:07.57": "Last year's tax forms?",
	"01:08.76": "Yes. Here they are.",
	"01:16.64": "OK. What ... what kind of house did you have in mind?",
	"01:19.48": "We're talking about buying",
	"01:20.67": "a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco.",
	"01:23.09": "Here are the financial details on the house.",
	"01:25.17": "Thank you.",
	"01:29.12": "Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment?",
	"01:31.43": "Yes, we are.",
	"01:33.39": "Payments over thirty years?",
	"01:35.27": "Yes.",
	"01:39.07": "Do you think we can get a loan?",
	"01:41.42": "Well, it depends. Do you own any other property?",
	"01:46.14": "Any stocks or bonds?",
	"01:49.25": "No.",
	"01:50.83": "I see. Then you don't have any collateral.",
	"01:55.94": "Perhaps you could get a guarantor--",
	"01:57.82": "someone to sign for the loan for you.",
	"02:00.88": "Why is that necessary?",
	"02:02.69": "Since you don't have enough income,",
	"02:04.26": "and you don't already own any property,",
	"02:06.38": "the bank needs to be sure",
	"02:07.53": "you can pay the mortgage every month.",
	"02:09.57": "A guarantor is responsible for the loan",
	"02:11.53": "if you can't make the payments.",
	"02:13.88": "I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting.",
	"02:20.49": "Thank you, Mr. Riley. We'll read this over carefully.",
	"02:24.37": "Thank you.",
	"02:25.33": "Good-bye. Thanks.",
	"02:26.25": "Good-bye. And hope to see you soon.",
	"02:29.98": "I hope so, too.",
	"02:31.32": "Take care.",
	"02:31.94": "Good-bye.",
	"02:51.41": "It all sounded so easy",
	"02:52.68": "until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor.",
	"02:57.13": "We have no collateral.",
	"03:00.21": "And I don't think it's a good idea",
	"03:01.40": "to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor.",
	"03:04.89": "I don't feel right about it.",
	"03:06.35": "I understand your feelings about it, Richard.",
	"03:21.52": "Now, tell me, what's the problem?",
	"03:25.98": "We can get a loan from the bank",
	"03:28.32": "if we can put up some collateral.",
	"03:30.51": "And we don't own anything to use as collateral.",
	"03:33.24": "Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor.",
	"03:39.07": "Why don't you speak to Dad?",
	"03:40.96": "No. If we buy a house, I want to be able to handle it alone.",
	"03:46.07": "Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard.",
	"03:49.18": "I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen.",
	"03:51.21": "In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book",
	"03:54.48": "and be able to put more money down.",
	"03:57.13": "What about the house in Mount Kisco?",
	"04:00.62": "Somebody else'll buy it by then.",
	"04:02.74": "Then there'll be other houses, Marilyn.",
	"04:05.35": "Richard has a point. You're just beginning to look.",
	"04:08.85": "We're in no great rush. It's true.",
	"04:10.57": "This has been a great learning experience for us, Marilyn.",
	"04:13.34": "Talking to the real-estate agent.",
	"04:14.88": "Looking at the houses.",
	"04:17.34": "Talking to the loan officer at the bank.",
	"04:20.00": "It has been a learning experience. That's true.",
	"04:23.61": "I think you're doing the right thing. Taking your time.",
	"04:26.45": "Looking around. Especially with a purchase of this kind.",
	"04:29.99": "You're talking about a lot of money.",
	"04:33.48": "We'll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us.",
	"04:36.98": "And I'll call Mr. Riley at the bank",
	"04:38.52": "and tell him we'll see him in a couple of months.",
	"04:42.01": "And if you ever need Dad or me to help you ...",
	"04:44.82": "We know.",
	"04:45.71": "You know we'll be there for you.",
	"04:48.17": "It's a Stewart tradition. We're a family."
