	"00:08.60": "It's certainly a good idea.",
	"00:11.03": "If I could take a look at the place,",
	"00:13.07": "I could probably tell what it requires to fix it up.",
	"00:17.11": "How much paint, how many hours of work ...",
	"00:21.33": "That's what I came to ask you to do, Malcolm.",
	"00:24.29": "If you would supervise the refurbishing,",
	"00:26.90": "I'll find the people to help do it.",
	"00:30.17": "I'll help too, Mr. Baker.",
	"00:32.17": "I can get some of my friends to go around the neighborhood",

	"00:45.32": "Sure.",
	"00:46.15": "We might need you to come through with your friends, Robbie.",
	"00:48.73": "Not just to go around the neighborhood asking for furniture,",
	"00:51.34": "but to help with the paint job.",
	"00:54.11": "That's backbreaking work and may be too much for us.",
	"00:58.03": "I'll do it. I'll talk to them.",
	"01:00.37": "And tomorrow morning we'll all meet here to discuss the plan?",

	"01:26.47": "Come in, come in. Please, come in.",

	"01:43.30": "Hello, Joanne. Nice to meet you.",
	"01:45.33": "My pleasure, Malcolm.",
	"01:46.79": "And this is Abe Lucas. You must remember Abe.",
	"01:50.25": "He ran the drugstore",
	"01:51.56": "and used to play drums with the jazz band on weekends.",
	"01:54.36": "Oh, sure I do. Hi, Abe.",
	"01:56.14": "Hello, Mr. Stewart.",

	"02:06.19": "Where's your grandson Robbie and his friend Alexandra?",
	"02:09.27": "Weren't they going to be here this morning?",
	"02:11.50": "I thought so, too.",
	"02:15.24": "I'm surprised they're not here.",
	"02:17.24": "Robbie left early this morning to meet Alexandra.",
	"02:21.08": "Frankly, I thought they'd be here, but ...",
	"02:25.54": "It's OK. I'm sure they meant well,",
	"02:27.57": "but they probably had other things on their minds.",
	"02:30.42": "I understand you used to be in the construction business,",
	"02:33.15": "Malcolm.",
	"02:33.96": "I was, indeed.",
	"02:35.85": "I wonder if you would take a look at the old library",
	"02:38.85": "and make sure that it is in good condition",
	"02:41.62": "so that we don't have to worry",
	"02:43.00": "about any structural problems.",
	"02:45.84": "When can I do that? I'd be happy to.",
	"02:48.34": "We've got permission to go inside the old building",
	"02:51.15": "during the week--",
	"02:52.87": "Tuesday or Wednesday.",
	"02:55.14": "That's fine with me. I can do it either day.",
	"02:57.60": "That would be very helpful.",
	"02:59.68": "I think the building just needs a good cleaning.",
	"03:02.49": "And a good paint job.",
	"03:05.07": "Then we have to furnish it.",
	"03:06.95": "I wish Robbie and Alexandra had come to this meeting.",
	"03:10.77": "They had some ideas about getting the place fixed up.",
	"03:13.73": "Perhaps they'll show up. In the meantime,",
	"03:16.96": "let me give you some additional thoughts and ideas I have.",
	"03:21.18": "OK.",
	"03:23.07": "Go ahead, Joanne.",
	"03:24.95": "As I said, mostly the building just needs a good cleaning.",
	"03:30.52": "This place can be developed",
	"03:32.25": "with one real intergenerational program.",
	"03:36.47": "That's an idea I like.",
	"03:38.51": "A community center",
	"03:40.06": "with the kinds of programs that fit everyone.",
	"03:42.72": "And programs that don't leave anyone out.",
	"03:46.22": "It's asking a lot.",
	"03:48.06": "But we can't do it without talking to the young people.",
	"03:51.02": "Finding out what they want.",
	"03:52.87": "If only Robbie and Alexandra were here.",
	"03:55.40": "Don't be upset, Malcolm.",
	"03:57.32": "We'll have a chance to talk to them later.",
	"04:00.13": "It's not like Robbie.",
	"04:02.55": "If he says he's going to be here, he's here.",
	"04:06.23": "I wonder what the problem is."
