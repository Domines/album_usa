	"04:14.85": "With your background and experience,",
	"04:16.31": "I can learn something",
	"04:17.57": "... and I do need some advice on a difficult problem.",
	"04:19.84": "Let me show you this.",
	"04:24.79": "I don't want to give you a final opinion",
	"04:28.20": "without studying these building plans more carefully.",
	"04:31.92": "But a simple solution might be",
	"04:35.03": "to move the air-conditioning units",
	"04:37.37": "instead of redesigning the entire system.",
	"04:40.71": "It might be simpler and less expensive.",
	"04:44.89": "You just earned your weight in gold, Malcolm.",
	"04:48.08": "Welcome aboard!",
	"04:52.87": "It all happened so quickly!",
	"04:54.98": "I can't believe it!",

	"05:22.62": "I owe you a good steak dinner.",
	"05:25.62": "I'll accept.",
	"05:27.23": "Tomorrow night.",
	"05:28.23": "You and me. Dinner.",
	"05:29.95": "What time?",
	"05:31.58": "I'll pick you up here at seven.",
	"05:33.34": "Is that OK?",
	"05:34.53": "I can't wait!",
	"05:35.88": "And you can tell me",
	"05:36.53": "all about your first full day back on the job.",
