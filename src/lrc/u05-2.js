	"02:13.79": "Well, first, you have to turn your hat around like this.",
	"02:18.90": "Then you close your eyes and say the magic words.",
	"02:23.81": "Fish, fish, send me a fish.",
	"02:32.72": "Fish, fish, send me a fish.... I got one!",
	"02:39.60": "See, it works!",
	"02:41.40": "It's a big one!",
	"02:42.40": "Well, it always worked for me, too.",
	"02:45.60": "Grandpa, get the net, please!",
	"02:55.56": "Dad, you got one, too!",
	"02:57.06": "You bet I have!",
	"02:58.33": "Easy, Philip, easy.",
	"03:04.87": "Sorry, Dad.",
	"03:07.82": "Well, one more and I've got a pair of boots.",
	"03:13.58": "You didn't say the magic words.",
	"03:15.39": "Robbie's right.",
	"03:16.62": "Yes, but you did, and we've got our lunch.",
	"03:19.58": "Let's build a fire and cook it!",
	"03:20.96": "Come on, Albert, you can help us!",
	"03:23.30": "I want to stay here and fish.",

	"03:39.37": "I think so.",
	"03:40.26": "I hope you like your fish well done.",
	"03:44.68": "Burned, you mean.",
	"03:46.37": "Hey, I'm a doctor, not a chef.",
	"03:58.69": "Help! Help! I can't swim!",
	"04:02.07": "Dad! Grandpa! He fell in!",
	"04:22.67": "Easy does it, Robbie.",
	"04:24.52": "That a boy.",
	"04:25.71": "That's it.",
	"04:26.30": "He's not breathing, Philip!",
	"04:28.26": "Robbie, run to the car!",
