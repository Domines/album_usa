	"02:00.77": "I do, too.",
	"02:01.65": "I don't care for a ranch type.",
	"02:03.65": "OK.",

	"02:12.56": "It looks wonderful.",
	"02:14.02": "This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house.",
	"02:16.56": "It has a full basement,",
	"02:18.06": "and it is on a half-acre lot.",
	"02:20.40": "You can probably afford this one.",
	"02:23.20": "I like this house.",

	"02:34.46": "If someone doesn't buy it before then,",
	"02:37.34": "But let's keep looking.",
	"02:40.22": "Just to get an idea of some other possibilities.",
	"02:43.18": "This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.",
	"02:46.83": "Here.",
	"02:47.87": "This is a wonderful example of Spanish-style architecture.",
	"02:51.56": "Oh,",
	"02:52.10": "I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.",
	"02:55.60": "It looks like the houses in Hollywood.",
	"02:58.24": "It's interesting.",
	"02:59.74": "A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price.",
	"03:12.80": "Oh my!",
	"03:15.53": "Here's a real buy.",
	"03:18.56": "It's a bargain.",
	"03:19.37": "This house just came on the market.",
	"03:21.80": "It's quite lovely.",
	"03:23.11": "Is it a two-bedroom house?",

	"03:27.64": "I know the house.",
	"03:28.87": "It has a brand new kitchen.",
	"03:30.52": "And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling.",
	"03:33.75": "And there's a two-car garage.",
	"03:35.75": "Then why don't we go look at this house, too?",
	"03:37.67": "It's a good investment.",
	"03:40.09": "Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.",
	"03:41.20": "Thanks so much.",

	"03:54.31": "I'll give them your regards.",
	"03:55.65": "We really appreciate your advice.",
	"03:58.07": "I do think you should go see the houses",
	"04:00.07": "and talk to the bank.",
	"04:01.53": "Here.",
	"04:02.07": "Let me give you some information sheets about the houses.",
	"04:09.82": "They're both very good buys.",
	"04:12.09": "Well, thanks so much for your help and your time,",
	"04:14.97": "Mrs. Martinelli.",
	"04:16.39": "We've got a lot to talk about.",
